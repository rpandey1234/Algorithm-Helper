This project is no longer maintained: please download the improved version of [Algorithm Helper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.stanford.algorithms), and check out the content on github [here](https://github.com/rpandey1234/AlgorithmHelper). 


---- 

Algorithm Helper covers common topics discussed in software interviews, including graph algorithms, binary search trees, linked lists, and sorting. We provide an overview and common interview questions for each topic. The coverage is broad and lightweight enough to be helpful to the advanced undergraduate or professional who would like to sharpen his/her technical interview skills on the go. To be as general and accessible as possible, we tried to make algorithm questions language agnostic.
Most of the content came from two courses taught at Stanford University:
- CS 161, Design and Analysis of Algorithms (cs161.stanford.edu). I borrowed heavily from the notes compiled by Moor Xu.
- CS 106B, Programming Abstractions (cs106b.stanford.edu). The 106B course reader was a valuable source of information.

"Just for Today"
--------
Just for today I will not be afraid of failing. I will read something that requires effort and focus.
Just for today, I will not find fault in others.
Just for today, I will spend some time reflecting and meditating. I will not check my email or my phone.
Just for today...
