<h1>Sorting Questions </h1>

<div class="accordion">
	<p class="collapse">Why is quicksort generally better than mergesort?</p>
	<div class="answer">
		<p> Typically, quicksort is significantly faster in practice than other O(nlogn) algorithms, because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures, and in most real-world data, it is possible to make design choices which minimize the probability of requiring quadratic time.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p></p>
	<p class="collapse">Under what circumstance will Bubble sort perform poorly?</p>
	<div class= "answer">
		<p> If the array is completely sorted except the least element is last, then the algorithm will take O(n<sup>2</sup>) bubbling it down. Selection sort will always take O(n<sup>2</sup>) operations.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p></p>
	<p class="collapse">Real world application?</p>
	<div class="answer">
		<p> In the real-world, it is rare that the data is completely random. Based on the data set, it is usually best to use a combination of sorting algorithms.</p>
