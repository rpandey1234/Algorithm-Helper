<h1>Graph Questions</h1>
<div class="accordion">
	<p class="collapse">If you perform a depth first search in a binary tree, what traversal will you obtain?</p>
	<div class="answer">
		<p>In depth-first order, we always attempt to visit the node farthest from the root. Thus we get pre-order traversal.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p></p>
	<p class="collapse">In a connected undirected graph with n nodes, what is the minimum number of edges?</p>
	<div class="answer">
		<p>The minimum number of edges is n-1. It helps to think about the extreme case: 
		If there were only two vertices, then there can only be one edge.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p></p>
	<p class="collapse">In a connected undirected graph with n nodes, what is the maximum number of edges?</p>
	<div class="answer">
		<p>Each vertex can have an edge to each of the other n-1 vertices. Thus the the maximum 
		number of edges is (n-1)n for directed graphs, and (n-1)n/2 for undirected graphs.</p>
